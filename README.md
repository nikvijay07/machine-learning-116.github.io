**Introduction**

Heart failure is a life threatening condition that plagues many of the healthcare systems and population globally. It happens when your heart is not able to pump blood properly to meet the needs of your body [1]. Early detection is key for receiving proper treatment and mitigation of consequences like strokes or heart attacks down the line. For our project, we set out to apply machine learning techniques to this field to predict if patients have a heart disease. Testing for heart disease today relies on a variety of different measures like blood tests, MRI scans, CT scans, or even exercise tests, as not one specific one can tell you the full picture [5]. Given the multimodality of the current state of testing, it highlights a tradeoff to be made for any model: less features generally allows a more widely applicable model however specialized features could produce a higher accuracy.  

Our dataset [2] is a labeled Kaggle dataset that combines multiple individual datasets internationally into 1 dataset to provide a more diverse range of information. It includes the following features:

1. Age 
2. Sex
3. Chest Pain Type:
4. Resting Blood Pressure
5. Cholesterol
6. Fasting Blood Sugar
7. Resting ElectroCardiogram Results
8. Maximum Heart Rate
9. Exercise Induced Angina
10. Oldpeak
11. ST_Slope
12. Heart Disease
